# CTJSSolutions
If you're in the same school as me and take the CT Advanced course, here are some solutions to the slideshows. Do not copy and paste, as the purpose of this repository is for you to check answers.

# Other Information
SquidWeb v1.0 is provided in this repository. If you want to host these JS files on a server, you can use it. An example usage script is also provided so that you can know how to use it.
